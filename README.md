I'm a part-time coder that makes things. My most popular repository is my XION-ChaseCam. I see it used all the time on streams and videos, and even other folks have used it in software. It's public domain and I enjoy the fact others have used it.  If you'd like your name included in the readme for that repository, submit a pull-request on that repository and I'll add it in. Be sure to include a link to the social platform (or github) you wish to be contacted on.

Otherwise, everyone have fun and be excellent to each other!
